# Machine-Learning

Neural Network: This assignment is designed to provide students with a hands-on experience with implementation of generative models and application of generated data in data augmentation for classification tasks. Specifically, students will use the AdaIN (Adaptive Instance Normalization) style transfer model for generating new data and apply these techniques in a classification task.
