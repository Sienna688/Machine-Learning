# Machine-Learning

Neural Network: 
This assignment is designed to provide students with hands-on experience with implementation of generative models and application of generated data in data augmentation for classification tasks. Specifically, students will use the AdaIN (Adaptive Instance Normalization) style transfer model for generating new data and apply these techniques in a classification task.

Regression & Classification: 
The objectives of this programming assignment are:
• To practice data importing and preprocessing skills using the pandas library.
• To better understand supervised learning methods by using scikit-learn.
• To evaluate the performance of several supervised learning methods by conducting an empirical study on a real-world dataset.
